# Machine Learning Course - Class Project 1 - Fall 2023

## Project Overview

This repository contains code and files for implementing various machine learning methods for thr first project of the machine learning class. The project's main goal is to develop and evaluate different machine learning algorithms on a dataset and prepare a submission file for AI Crowd. The project primarily utilizes the numpy and matplotlib libraries for data manipulation and visualization.

## Files and Structure

The project includes the following files:

1. `run.ipynb`: This Jupyter Notebook imports a pretrained model obtained from ridge regression, applies it to the dataset, and creates a CSV file suitable for submission on AI Crowd

2. `train.ipynb`: This Jupyter Notebook is dedicated to training our best working model using ridge regression. It creates a txt file that can then be imported in run.ipynb.

3. `utils.py`: This Python script contains useful functions used throughout the project.

4. `implementations.py`: This Python script includes the implementation of the six main machine learning methods that were implemented during the labs.

5. `plots.ipynb`: This Jupyter Notebook is used to generate relevant plots for the project report. It includes hyperparameter search plots and plots for an ablation study. The different plots are seperated by markdowns.

6. `w.txt`: This file stores a pretrained model that is used in the `run.ipynb` notebook.

## Data

The project data should be put in the folder called `dataset`. You can download the dataset from the following URL: [ML_course repository on GitHub](https://github.com/epfml/ML_course).


## Running the Code

To run the code in this project, follow these steps:

1. Make sure you have the necessary libraries (numpy, and matplotlib), installed in your Python environment. You can set up a Conda environment with the required libraries using the following steps:

```bash
conda create --name ml-project python=3.8
conda activate ml-project
conda install numpy matplotlib
```

2. If you only want to test our model. We have already generated a ready to use `w.txt` file that contains our pretrained model obtained from ridge regression. You can obtain the csv file by running the file `run.ipynb`, you then have to submit this file on aicrowd to get the f1-score and accuracy on the testing set. Make sure to run all the blocks in order.

2. If you want to train the model yourself, open and run the `train.ipynb` notebook. Make sure to run all the blocks in order. After training, you can use the pretrained model by opening and running the `run.ipynb` notebook to create a submission file for AI Crowd.

4. Use the `plots.ipynb` notebook to generate relevant plots for your project report, such as hyperparameter search and ablation study plots.
